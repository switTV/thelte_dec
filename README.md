all the ecember days i'll be learning about Threlte :)

## Day 1
i was creating the repo and i do my first scene

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/switTV/threlte_dec/main/static/dia1.png)

if you pass the mouse over the cube it will be bigger ;)

## Day 2

i modify the rectangle and transform him for a rounded cube

today i learn about:
* <Sky> just a big cube that looks like a sky
* <OrbitControls> & enableDamping: OrbitControls as him name says is for have a camera orbit control over your scene and the enableDamping is to add a smooth touch to the movement
* DoubleSide:
``` javascript
<T.Mesh
  rotation.x={-Math.PI / 2}
  receiveShadow
  material={new MeshStandardMaterial({side: DoubleSide, color: "white"})}
>
  <T.CircleGeometry args={[4, 40]}/>
</T.Mesh>
```
a code says more than 1000 words

and also i had learn some things more besides that i mentioned before but they are not 
that important ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
